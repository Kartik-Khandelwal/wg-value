# Share of Voice

Question: If a supporting business values a "share of voice" metric, how can the value of a community be expressed in those terms?

## Description

Share of voice (SOV) is a measurement of brand ownership compared to competitors on a given set of platforms. It can be used to gauge one product, community, or project's visibility in a competitive space. Organizations, which are often larger enterprise corporations, value it as a signal of power over others in a crowded market.

## Objectives

Open source-related communities compete for attention in a crowded market. When the supporting organization or executive sponsor responds well to competitive metrics, use share of voice to show the community's percentage of market share. That measurement can either be effective on its own or an opportunity to show growth in share of voice through further investment. 

## Implementation

Divide a target metric that represents your community by the total of that same metric that represents the market or industry. A percentage is then achieved by multiplying by 100. 

```
Share of voice = community metric / total market metric * 100
```

Share of voice can be effective when its objectives and assumptions are agreed upon. Here are some examples to consider.

**Objectives**

- TODO

**Assumptions** 

- There exists a public location that can be measured and is strategic to the project such as public blog posts, reviews, Twitter conversation, conference talks, StackOverflow tags.
- More conversation about a community is good (adage: ‘there is no such thing as bad publicity’), therefore increasing share of voice on a given set of community sites is valuable.
- There is a competitor that comes to mind, whether its internal competition where you compare community share of voice to other departments, or an external comparison where you focus on the top three companies in a given space (ex. comparing how N projects from X, Y, or Z companies compete for conversation around Data Science).
- Competitors must be measurable throught the same means in order to have a representative list data points.
- There exists a trusted and repeatable system of measurement, ideally software used by multiple teams for multiple programs. For example, the Public Relations, Analyst Relations, and Demand Generation team all use the same software to measure "exposure." The community can use the same tooling to measure share of voice.

If these statements are not applicable to your situation, abandon SOV immediately. It’s not for you at this moment. Rely on anecdotes or something else.

### Visualizations

One example made with PowerPoint:

### Tools Providing the Metric

_This depends completely on what you've decide to measure._ Here are a few examples, which are far from an exhuastive list. Please add others as you find them.

- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/) for relative search traffic.
- [StackOverflow Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) for SOV on StackExchange sites.
- [Export Tweet](https://www.exporttweet.com/) to measure hashtag SOV.
- [Hootsuite Analytics](https://hootsuite.com/platform/analytics) for broader social media Share of Voice.
- [Sysomos](https://sysomos.com/platform/analyze/) for social and press article Share of Voice.

### Data Collection Strategies

The framing of how the Share of Voice will be used as a measurement impacts data collection decisions. Examples:

1. **Impact around an event**. To secure funding for participation at an industry conference, you present the impact our community activities will have on the visibility of your community in a given space. Given the influence of Twitter on technology perception, you offer to compare the SOV of you and your community around the event in comparison to your top 3 competitors. To measure, you use Export Tweet to download all data around one or more keywords. You then use a regular expression to count the % of conversation your community had relative to other communities and show that you had an impact. For best results, establish a baseline by downloading historical data around this topic, which is likely to show a growth in SOV due to your work.
2. **Value per budget**. Starting from a similar event strategy as #1, add an additional comparison. Collaborate with colleagues where you know how much they spend for "visibility" at conferences to show an additional angle to this measurement. The result will be something like: "we grew our percentage of SOV by 34% relative to our competitors, and we did so for X amount of money, which is 1/5th the cost of just hosting a booth or 1/3rd the cost of running an evening event."
